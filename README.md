<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This project allows you to display horizontally scrolling text on two LED matrices using an ESP32, Wi-Fi, and a Telegram bot. It's perfect for remotely displaying customized messages through Telegram.

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have the following hardware and software components:
- 1 x ESP32
- 2 x LED Matrix (8x8 or 16x16)
- Jumper wires to connect the LED matrices to the ESP32
- Power supply for the ESP32
- Your Telegram Bot
- Your Telegram Chat ID

## Hardware Setup
1. Connect the two LED matrices together.
2. Connect the first LED matrix to the ESP32 according to the following scheme:

   | ESP32 Pin | LED Matrix Pin |
   | --------- | -------------- |
   | 5V        | VCC            |
   | GND       | GND            |
   | D23       | DIN            |
   | D22       | CLK            |
   | D21       | CS             |

3. Ensure stable and sufficient power supply for the ESP32 and the LED matrices.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GiuseppePitruzzella/wrench
   cd wrench
   ```

2. **Configure credentials and token**:
   ```cpp
   #define WIFI_SSID "your-wifi-ssid"
   #define WIFI_PASSWORD "your-wifi-password"
   #define BOT_TOKEN "your-bot-token"
   #define CHAT_ID "your-chat-id"
   ```

3. **Upload the code to the ESP32**:

## Usage

<!-- Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources. -->
1. **Power on the ESP32** and ensure it connects to the Wi-Fi network. You will see connection details in the Arduino IDE serial monitor.
2. **Interact with the Telegram bot**:
   - Open Telegram and find your bot.
   - Send a text message to the bot. The text will be displayed in scrolling mode on the two LED matrices.
